Bricabrac is a club night where each song is a different genre from the last. Hip Hop careers into Greek Classical, House turns into Jazz. They needed a website which emulated this feeling of sonic whiplash visually, and supported their vibrant brand. I designed and coded [bricabrac.club](http://bricabrac.club).

The song request feature collected over 10 hours worth of song requests for the first night.
