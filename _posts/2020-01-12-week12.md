Matt, a graphic design student from Kingston, came to sit in on one of our design crits. He also told us a bit about his dissertation, which is about [place branding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_branding). We love having visitors! Drop me a line if you want to come visit us, or sit in on a crit. 



I continued work on our new place for all our content to live. Getting the names of things right has been tricky - what’s an article vs a section, a guide vs a collection etc. Getting the balance between generic enough to flex in the future vs easily understandable right now is hard.



Frank Chimero’s [blog post](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/wants-and-needs/) on software vs documents came at just the right time. It articulates some of the oddness of switching from designing for specific journeys (like when making a bit of our wills journey better) to designing documents. 



I’ve been predominantly working from a single article outwards. Ie: what does an article look like? What does a representation of that article look like? What does a collection of those representations of articles look like? This is different from the way I normally design (in journeys). It’s using different muscles which is fun. 



In Japan I spent lots of time playing [Taiko No Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin) - an arcade drumming game. My friend got the switch version for me for Christmas, which has been taking up an embarrassing amount of my evenings this week
