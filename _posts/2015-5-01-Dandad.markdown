Along with 40 or so others, I took part in the 2015 D&AD Academy. As part of the two weeks we worked in teams with Innocent Smoothies to develop their new ad campaign. I was invited to take part off the back of my D&AD New Blood entry, [BBC Flick](https://www.dandad.org/awards/new-blood/2015/bbc/2694/bbc-flick/), which won a wooden pencil.
