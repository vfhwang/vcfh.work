Iâ€™ve decided that I wanted to make my own badges. I thought the idea of making them out of mirror was fun - subverting the usual requirement of a badge to have a message.

I made one a circle, the natural shape for a badge, and one a shard, the natural shape for a mirror. I made a few pairs and packaged them up to sell.
