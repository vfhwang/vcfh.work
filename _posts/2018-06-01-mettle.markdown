[Mettle](https://mettle-studio.com), a small team of talented industrial designers and engineers, needed another pair of hands to help facilitate a series of workshops with GE Healthcare in America.

In each workshop I led a diverse team of GE employees, all non-designers, from research through ideation to prototyping and pitching in a matter of days. For example, in the Boston based workshop we created George, an AI lab assistant.
