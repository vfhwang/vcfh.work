I’ve led design on wills for the past 2 years, working with a multidisciplinary team to deliver a will writing service that is a joy to use, and motivates people to get it ticked off their to-do list (finally).

<h2>Let's get started</h2>

</div>


People put off taking the first step for years. Our job is to build momentum within the first 30 seconds, to prove our promise that you can finish your will in 15 minutes. 

When I joined Farewill we had a fairly typical onboarding flow. It made sure our service was suitable for people trying to sign up. To do that, it asked questions like ‘where do you live?’. This did a great job at screening for eligibility.

</div>

However, we noticed that more than half of people would drop off at the sign-up page. We came up with a working hypothesis: Whilst our onboarding flow was functional and easy to use, it wasn’t meeting people’s emotional needs. 

Using this insight we created a prototype that asked more questions about people's unique situation, such as their children, partner and house. Through this we could offer bespoke information about how Farewill can help in their particular situation - whether that’s choosing guardians for children or passing on their home.

We also know from watching people write their wills that some parts of the process are a pleasant surprise. For example, many people don’t know that you can write down your funeral wishes. 

I worked with Ethan, our copywriter, to create a list of three points for each unique situation. These are designed to be not only reassuring, but also reveal something unexpected that a will can do for you.

We show people this list, demonstrating that we understand their situation, just before asking for their details. We’ve seen in research that this page is a boost of energy before the hard work begins. 

<!-- <div class="image-contain">

</div>

Another place we noticed drop off was when choosing between single and couple wills.

Choosing between singles and couples right at the beginning - without knowing much about the product - was causing people to drop off. Felt like too much.

Two things. Firstly simplify the decision with just key information.

Secondly, think about the whole journey. Could want to add their partner at any time. Enable them to do that.  -->

Overall these changes resulted in nearly double the number of people who clicked 'Let's get started' signing up for an account.

<!-- with a higher proportion of those sign-ups being for a couple's will. -->

Within the flow - remove the opaque nature of making a will. From talking to customers realised that each step was not as clear as it could be.

One customer who had a terminal diagnosis said clicking purchase was like ‘giving into the inevitable’ - didn’t know what was going to come next. Felt final

We added steps. And people’s faces. Not being a faceless company sets us apart.

To make sure more people can get their will done.

I worked with Paula, legal telephone wills team, to better understand XYZ.

Organised shadowing of Paula

Then created a complex will drafting tool. Cut 20 minutes off each case. 

Worked with content designer, Ethan, to rewrite messages to get people over to telephone wills. 

Adding telephone wills into the onboarding flow. Made a few missteps before getting it right. Too complex.
