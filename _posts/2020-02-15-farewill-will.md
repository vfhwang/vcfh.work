I’ve led design on wills for the past 2 years, working with a multidisciplinary team to deliver a will writing service that is a joy to use, and motivates people to get it ticked off their to-do list (finally).

<h2>Let's get started</h2>

</div>


People put off taking the first step for years. Our job is to build momentum within the first 30 seconds, to prove our promise that you can finish your will in 15 minutes. 

When I joined Farewill we had a fairly typical onboarding flow. It made sure our service was suitable for people trying to sign up. To do that, it asked questions about their location and if they had foreign assets.

</div>

However, we noticed that more than half of people would drop off at the sign-up page. We came up with a working hypothesis: Whilst our onboarding flow was functional and easy to use, it wasn’t meeting people’s emotional needs. 

Using this insight we created a prototype that asked more questions about people's unique situation, such as their children, partner and house. Through this we could offer bespoke information about how Farewill can help them specifically - whether that’s choosing guardians for children or passing on their home.

</div>


We also know from watching people write their wills that some parts of the process are a pleasant surprise. For example, many people don’t know that you can write down your funeral wishes. 

I worked with Ethan, our copywriter, to create a list of three points for each unique situation. These are designed to be not only reassuring, but also reveal something unexpected that a will can do for you. 

We show people this list, demonstrating that we understand their situation, just before asking for their details. We’ve seen in research that this page is a boost of energy before the hard work begins.

Overall these changes resulted in nearly double the number of people who clicked 'Let's get started' signing up for an account.

<h2>Wills for couples</h2>
<div class="screen"><img src="{{page.imagesurl}}couples-wills.png"></div>
<p class="caption">Redesigning how couples get their wills</p>
</div>

With Farewill each person in a relationship makes their own will, allowing for greater flexibility. One customer I spoke to said it gave them the space to write a message from the heart - something they wouldn’t have got in a high street solicitor. 

Although each person having their own account doesn’t match with most people’s mental model of a joint couple’s will, we believe the benefits mean it’s worthwhile. 

However, this was a lot to explain in an onboarding flow - resulting in a confusing page that led to people dropping off. 

<div class="image-contain">

</div>

I didn’t think redesigning this page would result in the conversion improvements we wanted. We therefore took a wider view, mapping out how couples use our product from start to finish.

</div>

We discovered that there’s usually an instigator in the relationship. Often this person has a look around the product themselves, makes a start and shows their partner. We reworked our journey to allow you to add your partner at any point, rather than just during onboarding.

Whilst many couples did bits of the will individually, most sat down together to send their wills off for checking - often on the same device. From this we decided to allow whoever finishes their will first to pay for both wills. 

<div class="image-contain">
<p class="caption">Redesigned payment page, allowing people to buy both wills</p>
<div class="screen"><img src="{{page.imagesurl}}couples-payment.png"></div>
</div>


We also found out that many couples share a central device, like a laptop. We heard that it was sometimes confusing to know whose account you were logged into. From finding this out we added the account holder's name to the main navigation - making it easy to know who's logged in. 

Since we implemented these changes 6 out of 10 wills are now sold to couples - up from 3 out of 10 when we started.

One of the customer conversations I’ll never forget was with someone living with a terminal cancer diagnosis. They were reluctant to send their will for checking, because finalising their will ‘felt like giving in’. 

With Farewill you can update your will and get it checked at any time after purchase, as many times as you want. However, from this conversation and others like it, we realised that wasn't as obvious as it should be.

<div class="image-contain">
<p class="caption">The old overview page</p>
<div class="screen"><img src="{{page.imagesurl}}overview-old.png"></div>
</div>


In fact, we found out that many people don’t know much about what happens after purchase at all. One of the biggest misconceptions was that Farewill was a ‘digital’ will - in reality all wills in the UK must be physical documents by law. 

To remedy all this we redesigned the main ‘overview’ page, the first thing you see when you log back in, to show people where in the writing process they are, and what comes next.

I wrote a research plan, and tested out a low-fi prototype built in Axure with participants. That gave us enough confidence, with some tweaks, to release the redesigned page.

This case study is just a snapshot of the work we've done as a team to make planning for your death easier. 

Since I joined Farewill we've become the nation's biggest will writer, whilst maintaining a 4.9/5 score on trustpilot and averageing an industry-leading 84 on NPS.
