Fantastic Archway, a never-to-be-completed architectural proposal, is an investigation into the power of imaginary architecture.

A pair of disused gate posts hide in an overgrown hedge, having been fenced off; rendered inaccessible. These are in the style of classical Greek columns, and are ridiculous on account of both their dysfunctionality and aesthetic clumsiness.

Rather than hide this ridiculousness, as much architecture is inclined to do, Fantastic Archway aims to harness it, welcoming visitors with a wave of itâ€™s classical column.
